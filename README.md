# Instagram-Page
## A project similar in looks to instagram.com

I used this project to primarily improve my css knowledge along with learning some new technologies

## Some stuff I've learned and/or practiced:
- SASS extension language
- proper project structure
- React and its various hooks
- many CSS capabilities
- and much more...

I have used this project to learn more about CSS and the SASS pre-processor.
I also further gained experience and confidence in my React knowledge.
